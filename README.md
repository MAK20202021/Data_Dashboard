##Data_Dashboard\
This project is to create a web Data Dash Board. This provides the fundamental ideas of Front-end, back-end libraries and the deployment that web app to the cloud.   

## Project Motivation:
To get the better idea about the development of a web app and deploy to the cloud, the basic languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript are essential. For the quick organization, bootstrap library and for getting a better visualization $Plotly is used.


Object Oriented Programming, it is a better idea to create a simple game. I always like to play Tic Tac Toe game from my childhood. Therefore, I chose this simple game to get better understanding of class, objects, methods and attributes. 
This project will provide the platform for Tic Tac Toe game between two players. It checkes all the probabilities of winning the game. It checkes the tie also.
After completing one round it will ask whether the players want to play again. If it gets the affirmative response it will refresh the game board and
start the new game.
